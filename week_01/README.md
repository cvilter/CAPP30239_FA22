Hi! I'm a second-year MSCAPP student. Before coming to UChicago I studied Political Economy at Georgetown University and spent four years as a Research Analyst at the Urban Institute in DC. Most of my work related to immigrants and refugees in the United States, and my role was to manage and analyze (but not often visualize) data. This past summer I interned at UChicago's Energy and Environment Lab, where I cleaned and prepared data for an EPA machine learning project. After grad school I hope to be a data scientist in a government or nonprofit context.
