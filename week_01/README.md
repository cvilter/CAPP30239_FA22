Hi! I'm a second-year MSCAPP student. Before coming to UChicago I studied Political Economy at Georgetown University and spent four years as a Research Analyst at the Urban Institute in DC. Most of my work related to [immigrants and refugees in the United States](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/131025/version/V1/view), and my role was to manage, analyze, and present (but not often visualize) data. This past summer I interned at UChicago's Energy and Environment Lab, where I cleaned and prepared data for an EPA machine learning project. After grad school I hope to be a data scientist in a government or nonprofit context. I took a data viz course in R years ago, but I'm looking forward to refreshing my data viz skillset.
