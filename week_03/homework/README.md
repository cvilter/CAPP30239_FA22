## Week 3 Bar Chart Exercise

Our bar chart depicts visits to public libraries near the University of Chicago in January 2022. Library branches are ranked by number of visits, and in-bar labels provide exact counts.

The viz was constructed using D3.js.

Our data and other public Chicago data can be found at the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Libraries-2022-Visitors-by-Location/ykhx-yxn9).
