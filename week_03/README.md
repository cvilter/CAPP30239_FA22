### Description
The Annual Survey of Refugees (ASR) is a nationally representative annual survey commissioned by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and administered by the Urban Institute. The resulting data include responses to a roughly 40-question questionnaire (not including subparts) from approximately 1,500 refugee households recently resettled in the United States.

### Interest
I’ve long been interested in the experiences of immigrants and refugees - I think they’re a critically important part of American (and global) society. I'm particularly interested in the Annual Survey of Refugees for two reasons: 1. it’s a methodologically robust and rare source of data for the topic, and 2. I spent four years on the small Urban Institute team that managed and analyzed the survey. In my time working on the ASR I approached it from many angles (including helping to publish this public-use version and create the user’s guide), but I rarely had a chance to visually represent the data, and never with any complexity. I’m interested in finding ways to clearly express the data in intuitive and illuminating visual formats.

### Data Points and Plans
The dataset contains both person-level and household-level data points. I expect to focus more on the person-level questions for consistency and also to take advantage of their larger sample size. The survey’s topics are varied, beginning with basic demographics like country of origin, age, and education and extending to English proficiency, work experience, health, public assistance, housing, etc. I think it could be interesting to illustrate any differences between male and female refugees, and/or between more- and less-recently arrived refugees. It could also be interesting to try to relate reported changes in English proficiency (the survey asks how well individuals spoke English at arrival in the U.S. vs. how well they speak it now) to variables like participation in English instruction, employment status, or parenthood. I’m sure other questions and potential visuals will emerge!

### Concerns
One concern is that the data, while publicly available for study and research, is not intended to be posted openly. The data files are housed at the ICPSR, and users have to create accounts in order to download and view them. I have an account, have downloaded the data, and have converted it to a csv per this assignment, but I will need to continue storing it locally (though I can save code and visuals here).

### Source Type
The data is a primary source (unanalyzed survey data).
