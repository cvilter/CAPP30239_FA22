    <h1>Exploration of Washington Post Police Violence Data</h1>
    <p>This page explores Washington Post data on the more than 1,500 people killed by police in the U.S. in 2015. 
        In particular, it explores the data on victims' mental illness status from multiple angles.
    </p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h3>Proportion of cases reported to involve mental illness</h1>
    <p>An important reference point is the overall proportion of officer-involved deaths in the dataset which were reported to involve mental illness
        ("Mental_illness" = True). A simple way to convey the values of a binary variable like this one is through a horizontal bar.
        We see that the majority of the cases represented in our 2015 dataset were not flagged as involving mental illness, but a 
        substantial minority of 21% were. <br><br>
        Considering that our dataset is a national aggregation offered by the Washington Post, it's likely to be a cleaned-up version
        of a significant number of smaller, different data sources from across the country. To better understand how the Washington Post's 
        "Mental_illness" flag captures the complicated topic of mental illness, it would be useful to know what data sources fed into 
        the larger dataset, how each source handled
        the issue, and what decision rules were used to create the final flag.
        <div class="horizontal_bar">
        <div style="width:79%;background-color: #e3ca4c;float:left;">No mental illness<br />78.7%</div>
        <div style="width:21%;background-color: #e46023;float:left;">Mental illness<br />21.3%</div>
        <br> <br>
    </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h3>Trends in proportion of cases involving mental illness over 2015</h1>
        <p> Keeping in mind the overall average provided in our first chart, 21%, it's interesting to ask whether there were any 
            trends in the proportion of police killings reported to involve a mentally ill victim over the course of 2015.
            A line chart is a logical choice to represent this data because it allows us to easily understand movement in a variable 
            of interest over time. <br><br>
            Our line chart shows a wide range - from 12 to 31% - and a cluster of noticeably higher proportions from 
            March to June compared to lower rates in the second half of the year, July to December. <br><br>
            This chart would have more impact if it were combined with data from the surrounding years. Expanding our chart to contain
            multiple cycles of data - or comparing line charts for multiple years - would enable us to observe whether the cycle that appeared 
            in 2015 constitutes an annual trend or an anomaly.

    <h3>Manner of death by mental illness status</h1>
        <p> One way to dig deeper into the role of mental illness in police killings is to examine whether individuals with a mental illness
            are markedly different than others across other variables of interest. Here we compare manner of death 
            between those victims whose cases were flagged as involving mental illness and those that were not. 
            We see that individuals with a mental illness were notably less likely to be shot and more likely to be tasered. 
            Exact frequencies are provided for context. <br><br>
            Given that we're comparing
            a categorical variable with few categories (shot, tasered, both) across a simple binary (no mental illness / mental illness),
            side-by-side donut charts effectively depict broad differences. Given additional categories, this type of visualization 
            would be difficult to interpret.<br><br><br>

            Note: Red sections represent individuals who were both shot and tasered.
