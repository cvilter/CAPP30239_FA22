      I grew up knowing my body wasn't exactly the same as other people's. I had “moderate to severe” 
      asthma and no memory of a day when I didn't take one short stack of medications shortly after waking up and 
      another before bed. In a way, the lifelong ubiquitousness of my condition actually camouflaged it 
      from me: I had no memories of onset or diagnosis, and medical routines were a simple fact of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was 23, the facts of my life underwent a dramatic shift. I started to feel sick, first in 
      persistent bouts and then essentially all the time. I came down with acute pneumonia and ended 
      up in the ER for the first time in my life, where doctors and nurses couldn't stop asking me 
      how I thought I'd gotten it - Was I around someone? Did something happen to me? I was at least 
      as confused as they were. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the succeeding months, my allergist observed that the basic lung function numbers she 
      collected every time I visited were stuck well below my baseline - around 80% of the predicted 
      levels for my age, technically still “normal” but not nearly normal for me. In March of 2019, 
      she ordered a CT scan and I began my medical journey in earnest.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <br>
    <h2>The Medical Journey</h2>
    <p>
      The CT came back highly irregular. Within weeks, I had met my first pulmonologist and had 
      undergone a bronchoscopy, a scope of the lungs. Our finding: terrible-looking lungs with a 
      rare, slow-growing underlying infection. More pulmonologists were acquired. In a twist I had 
      not been expecting, the bronchoscopy itself induced a second acute pneumonia which led to my 
      next medical milestone, my first hospital admission and multi-day stay. At the end of March, 
      I was released, and two important steps lay ahead of me: recovering from the acute pneumonia 
      and beginning treatment to resolve the underlying one. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As this saga unfolded, I was two years into a four-year stint at the Urban Institute as a 
      research analyst. As a researcher, and earlier as an economics student, I latched onto data 
      analysis as a way to tangle with interesting programming puzzles while staying grounded in 
      socially meaningful work. I relished the way thoughtful database design and informed analysis 
      could turn complex situations into concrete insights. So I decided to apply the same tools to 
      my otherwise out-of-control situation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For six months, from April to September of 2019, I kept a twice-daily Excel record of seven 
      features of my health including heart rate, blood oxygen level, and two lung function metrics. 
      The data tells the story of my slow recovery from acute pneumonia and its overlap with my 
      entrée into treatment for the long-term underlying infection we had just learned was the 
      cause of it all.
    </p>
    </div>

  <div class="container">
    <br>
    <h2>Examining the Data</h2>
    <p>
      The two lung function metrics I had available to me at home were peak expiratory flow (PEF) 
      and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1). Both metrics can be captured with a 
      handheld device that you blow into as hard as you can, and together they help characterize the 
      health of your lungs.
      <a href="#section1">[1]</a>
      <a href="#section2">[2]</a> 
      Expected PEF and FEV1 results are a function of your 
      gender, height, and age, and the units are different and inscrutable, so it's easiest to 
      understand them as percentages of expected values. 
      <a href="#section3">[3]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      As I began to track my numbers, I observed that my PEF and FEV1 results were roughly correlated. 
      When PEF went up, FEV1 was likely to improve, too. But the correlation wasn't perfect, and there 
      was an obvious disparity in my results that jumps out when 6 months of PEF data is plotted against 
      FEV1. 
    </p>
    <h3>PEF and FEV1 move together, but their levels are significantly different</h3>
    <div id="scatter"></div>
    <p>
      The y axis above, which captures FEV1, ranges from 70 to 105% of predicted with data spread evenly 
      from min to max. In contrast, the PEF values nearly all lie above 100% of predicted on the x axis, 
      effortlessly reaching the high highs of 135%. This makes sense for someone with my 2019 
      characteristics: both asthma and the underlying infection I had been diagnosed with are 
      characterized by obstruction, which is best captured by FEV1. 
      <a href="#section4">[4]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      One outlier stands out: a solitary data point at 82% PEF single-handedly extends the x axis fifteen 
      percentage points to the left. This point is the very first row of my dataset, data which was 
      recorded 3 days after my discharge from the hospital and 5 days before my data collection scheme 
      began in earnest. Clearly, my PEF *had* been affected by acute pneumonia - it simply bounced back 
      much more quickly than FEV1, so the trend was completely obscured by starting data collection 5 
      days later.
    </p>
    </div>

  <div class="container">

        <p style="margin: -35px 20px 0px 70px">
          This meant FEV1 was my sticking point. In the two and a half months that followed my bout with 
          acute pneumonia, it saw routine, relatively volatile fluctuations.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 25px 20px 0px 70px">
          Nonetheless, its trajectory was relatively flat, with a slow but steady trend toward improvement. 
          Recovery from pneumonia can be arduous, but this time we understood that I was hampered by an 
          underlying infection. The recommendation was to wait for treatment, but in June, I made the 
          choice to begin. 
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 240px 20px 0px 70px">
          The plan involved many, many antibiotics. Their onset was staggered over several weeks so that 
          individual side effects could be observed, and the ultimate result was many months of two to four 
          daily antibiotics at a time.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 25px 20px 0px 70px">

          It's difficult to imagine a more satisfying result. From June 26 through late July I 
          embarked on a steep upward trajectory thanks to the addition of antibiotics to my recovery regimen. 
          The hard facts don't always align with the experience, 
          but in this case they did: I felt fundamentally better almost right away, the change was reflected
          in my numbers, and the feeling didn't ebb.
        </p>
        <p style="margin: 455px 10px 0px 0px">
          Around July 19, after the first twenty-three days of what would turn into many months of treatment, my FEV1 numbers 
          completed their dramatic rise and entered a new plateau. Where 
          previously I had hovered around the 80% mark - acceptable, but not normal for me - I now settled 
          around the 100% mark. In 23 days, my entire baseline had been shifted back to where it belonged, 
          and I stayed at 100% of predicted FEV1 for the remaining months of my data experiment.

    <h3>Putting the pieces together: two plateaus joined by a steep upward shift that began with treatment</h3>
    <div id="line"></div>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      Clearly, the lung obstruction captured by FEV1 stood to improve significantly with antibiotic treatment
      for my underlying infection. As illustrated in the scatterplot above, PEF and FEV1 always had 
      sharply different ranges, and PEF was never in such dramatic need of a boost.
      But over the six months that I recorded data, my PEF numbers followed a similar - if 
      less stark - trajectory. 
    </p>
    <h3>PEF values shifted noticeably upward after the first day of treatment</h3>
    <div id="hist_before"></div>
    <div id="hist_after"></div>
    <p>
      Histograms of PEF values before beginning treatment (June 26) and from the first day of treatment onward
      demonstrate a clear discontinuity. Though my PEF numbers had never reflected the dramatic dip captured in FEV1, 
      evidently there was still room for them to improve. By September, both metrics were back to normal.

    <h2>The Metadata</h2>
    <p>
      When I dug up these data three years later, it occurred to me that my six-month-long record also contained 
      a larger story about the experience of recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      I designed my original data collection spreadsheet with an eye toward analyzability: clearly defined columns, 
      consistent formats, numeric data. But I decided to throw in one text field with room for open-ended 
      reflections on how I was actually feeling. My sense was that it could provide the hard facts with important 
      context. In the beginning I wrote in it every day: “Some shortness of breath, ear pain, cough.” “Lungs feeling tight 
      and I did this because I was worried, but somehow managed my best read ever.” “Not great."
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the months wore on, I used the text field less and less, opting to focus on the essentials 
      rather than linger over descriptions of my state of being. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to me in retrospect that the frequency with which I filled in the text field, week over week, 
      served as a proxy for something bigger: my level of preoccupation with my health.
    </p>
    <h3>Over time, the number of qualitative notes I recorded each week dropped off dramatically</h3>
    <div id="bar"></div>
    <p>
      It's clear that, while the hard facts were helpful enough to keep an eye on twice a day for six months, 
      my upward trajectory eventually reassured me enough to let me step away from the text field.

    <h2>Reflections on My Project Process</h2>
    <p>
      As I searched for data that would lend itself to being visualized in the form of a story, it occurred 
      to me that I had a dataset of my own that was waiting to be fully analyzed and understood. I decided 
      to give it a closer look, and the story jumped right out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The centrality of FEV1 and PEF to lung health and to my narrative made them the obvious choice for most 
      of my visualizations. It was clear that the stark trends in FEV1 needed to be displayed in a line chart 
      over time, and revealing the chart piece by piece allowed me to accompany the text without giving the whole 
      picture away. I quickly decided to represent both FEV1 and PEF in terms of predicted values because their 
      actual units (numbers like 3.3 and 350) don't make sense to the average reader. Percentages allowed for 
      instant comprehension. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some trial and error was required to solidify the formats of the other charts. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I originally intended to overlay the two PEF histograms but found that the distributions weren't quite 
      distinct enough for the combined chart to be readable. Putting one after the other while preserving a 
      common axis increased readability, and I found that having the post-treatment histogram “after” the first 
      histogram on the page subtly emphasized the notion that it contained mutually exclusive “later” data. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I also knew that I wanted to explore the correlation between PEF and FEV1. I originally considered turning 
      each one into a line graph over time and overlaying them with two y axes. But I found that using a scatter 
      plot introduced more visual variety to the overall project and gave a clearer picture of the associations 
      and outliers in the data. Using a scatter plot also allowed me to remove the data from the time axis 
      underlying the rest of my visualizations and see things in a different light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I created this dataset myself (albeit three years ago), confined it to a few key variables of interest, 
      and set the process up with analysis in mind, I encountered fewer data challenges than usual I know from 
      experience with survey analysis, machine learning, and the like that data extraction, comprehension, cleaning, 
      and wrangling can easily demand at least as much time as “the project itself.” Each of my D3 charts required 
      its own cleaned, tailor-made dataset, but otherwise the data process for this project was much simplified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, many wish list items did not make it into my project's final form. Given more time, I would be 
      interested to explore how the story could be enhanced by the remaining variables in my dataset - heart rate and 
      blood oxygen level in particular. I also would have liked to explore more complicated chart types and introduce 
      interactivity. For example, it would be interesting to be able to put any point in the PEF/FEV1 scatterplot in 
      context by hovering over it and seeing the date it was recorded. I would also be curious to separate out my data 
      by whether it was collected in the morning or at night and assess whether the volatility of FEV1 and PEF (as 
      captured in the FEV1 line chart) is a pendulum driven by time of day or simply represents random day-over-day 
      variation.
    </p>
    <p>
      My greatest data wish would be to have personal FEV1 and PEF data extending out infinitely in either direction, 
      filling in the missing context for these findings. These six months in 2019 are perfect fodder for analysis because  
      they represent such a unique and dynamic moment, but they beg for contextualization for the same reason. At least 
      I can say with confidence - although not in laborious detail - that my numbers today are very good.
