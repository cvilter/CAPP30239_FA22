#### Carolyn Vilter

This repository contains json and csv data, ipynb data cleaning, javascript, and html files for my December 2022 Data Viz final project. 
In it I analyze personal data from 2019 spanning my 6-month recovery from an unexpected bout of pneumonia and the resulting
lung disease diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. 

Folders and files:
- data/
    - clean/: cleaned data named according to chart type
    - raw/: my original files 
    - clean.ipynb: data cleaning and prep converting raw/ files to clean/
- javascript/: js files for each visualization, labeled by type
- planning/: contains pdf with original concept and sketches
- styles.css: overarching style file
- project.html: the html that produces [this final result](https://cvilter.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/project/project.html)
