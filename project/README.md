## Visualizing Lung Disease Diagnosis, Treatment, and Recovery
### UChicago CAPP 30239: Data Visualization for Policy Analysis
### Fall 2022 Final Project
#### Carolyn Vilter

This repository contains data, javascript, html, ipynb data cleaning, and pdf planning files for my Data Viz final project. 
In it, I analyze personal data from 2019 spanning my 6-month recovery from an unexpected bout with pneumonia and the resulting
lung disease diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. The dramatic trends, intuitive associations, and satisfying outcomes captured
in the dataset make perfect fodder for visualization.

Folders and files:
- data/
    - clean/: cleaned data named according to chart type
    - raw/: my original files 
    - clean.ipynb: data cleaning and prep converting raw/ files to clean/
- javascript/: js files for each visualization, labeled by type
- planning/: contains pdf with original concept and sketches
- styles.css: overarching style file
- project.html: the html that produces [this final result](https://cvilter.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/project/project.html)
